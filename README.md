# jacket

CLI for Apache mod_jk status worker (because antiquated tech is cool!)

## Install

```sh
$ npm install -g jacket
```

## Configuration

Currently requires a `jacket.json` file to be defined in the current working directory. More to come later...

## Usage

Refer to the CLI help text for now. Will update this later.

```sh
$ jacket -h
```

## Everything else

TBD
